# dwarfmaster ranks
A template for a rank system within 7 Days to die

This is just a simple template for a system that allows you to add ranks to your server. You can of course add more ranks or remove them.

**Important**
This template uses recipes that you most likely do not have on your server/system. Either adapt them or delete them.
You can also just leave them in, because they do nothing.

### Install
copy the folder `dwarfmaster_ranks` in to your `Mods`-folder (local or serverside)

### Configuration

Open the `Localization.txt` and look there how the names and texts are. Adjust them according to your wishes.

Optional
* set the max level in the `progession.xml` > default is 1000
* add/remove ranks in the frist section of the `buffs.xml`
* set/update the ranks in the second section where every rank is listed
